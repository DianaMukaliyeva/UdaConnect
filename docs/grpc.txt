# Documentation of grpc endpoint and how to make a sample request

Locations-api has 2 grpc endpoints: one creates Locations and another retrieve Location by id

To send sample request you can use file `modules/locations-api/app/client.py` - if you have running services locally.
The only change needed is to adjust line 10 of this file so `channel = grpc.insecure_channel("localhost:5005")` so that it connects to correst host and port number.

The parameters could be changed.
